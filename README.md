## üìñ TL;DR
This automatically generates an up-to-date calendar you can subscribe to using your favorite calendar app,
to never miss an IFSC climbing event ever again. Currently supported formats are `.ics` (iCal) and `json`.

#### How?
Copy and paste this calendar URL <code>**https://calendar.ifsc.stream**</code> into your calendar subscriptions, and it will
automatically sync with your device. This works on iPhone, Google Calendar, Proton Calendar, etc... This should keep
you updated on future seasons as well.

Take a look at the **[setup guides](https://github.com/sportclimbing/ifsc-calendar/wiki)** for help.

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Version

Additionally, the calendar data is exported as `JSON` and can be viewed on this automatically updated
website:

<div align="center">
    <h3>üëâ <a href="https://ifsc.stream">https://ifsc.stream</a></h3>
    (From there you can also subscribe to the calendar with just a few clicks!)
</div>

## üëã Intro
If you're constantly missing IFSC events because of a lacking calendar, or timezone confusions,
then you're at the right place.

This command line tool uses IFSC's APIs, plus some scraping (because the available APIs don't provide precise schedules)
to generate an always up-to-date calendar with all necessary info.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

- Updates automatically every hour
- Fetches schedules directly from IFSC's website (using some APIs and fancy scraping)
- Converts times to your local timezone
- Alerts an hour before events start
- Fetches stream URLs (and searches YouTube for missing ones)
- Works for future seasons once dates are published (may require some tweaks)
- Fetches start list for events
- Works on any calendar (not just Google)
- Fully open source

## üõ† Usage

#### Docker

Using the pre-built Docker image
```shell
$ docker run -it --volume "$PWD:/calendar" \
    ghcr.io/sportclimbing/ifsc-calendar:latest \ 
    --season 2025 \
    --output "/calendar/ifsc-calendar.ics"
```

> [!NOTE]
> All Docker images can be found on
> - [ghcr.io](https://github.com/sportclimbing/ifsc-calendar/pkgs/container/ifsc-calendar)
> - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/sportclimbing)

<hr />

#### Build Docker image locally

Build Docker image
```shell
$ docker build --tag ifsc-calendar .
```
Generate `.ics` calendar file
```shell
$ docker run -it --volume "$PWD:/calendar" ifsc-calendar \
    --season 2025 \
    --output "/calendar/ifsc-calendar.ics"
```

Generate `.json` calendar file
```shell
$ docker run -it --volume "$PWD:/calendar" ifsc-calendar \
    --season 2025 \
    --output "/calendar/ifsc-calendar.json" \
    --format json
```

Export multiple formats
```shell
$ docker run -it --volume "$PWD:/calendar" ifsc-calendar \
    --season 2025 \
    --output "/calendar/ifsc-calendar.json" \
    --format json,ics
```

<hr />

#### Build app locally (without Docker)
Build executable
```shell
$ make
```

Generate `.ics` calendar file using the generated `.phar`
```shell
$ ./build/ifsc-calendar.phar \
  --season 2025 \
  --output "ifsc-calendar.ics"
```
